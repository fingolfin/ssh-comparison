# The following information was provided by denis bider.
#
# Some version history:
# 
# - gss-group1, gss-gex, and GSSAPI auth since Server and Client 4.01
# - DH group exchange since Server and Client 4.01
# - CTR mode algorithms since Server 5.00, Client 4.27
# - RSA host keys since Server 5.00
# - SHA-256 (dh-gex-sha256 and hmac-sha-256) since Server 5.50, Client 6.00
# - ECDH and ECDSA since Server 6.04, Client 6.00
# - gss-group14 since Server and Client 6.41
# - SHA256 key fingerprints since Server and Client 6.41
# 
# For everything else, assume baseline, or too old to make note of: 4.01
# is itself 10 years old.
# 
# Note that our DH group exchange currently has the following shortcomings:
# 
# - The Server does not generate groups. It just gives the client
#   group14, or else group1 if clientâ€™s max size is below group14.
# 
# - The Client cannot reliably digest broken groups generated by most
#   implementations that actually generate groups on the fly.
# 
# The Client (and Server, but this is not a problem in the Server) uses
# a FIPS-compliant crypto provider which performs DH parameter
# validation that cannot be disabled. This validation fails on DH
# parameters with groups generated by most server implementations
# (including but not limited to OpenSSH). It is possible to connect, but
# with something like 50% chance of failure.
# 
# Since we cannot disable the DH parameter validation without
# compromising the FIPS module, the Client de-prioritizes DH-gex methods
# in favor of any other enabled key exchange method (by default ecdh,
# dh-group14).
