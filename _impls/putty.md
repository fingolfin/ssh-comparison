first-release:
    date: 1998
# It is not clear when exactly the first *public* PuTTY release was. The
# changelog starts at version 0.45, released 1999-01-22, and this is
# also the date Wikipedia lists. I contacted Simon Tatham about this,
# and he cannot fully reconstruct when the first release was. But with
# help from the Internet archive, it is clear that already version 0.43
# was released to the public, at the latest in in December 1998.
# The _name_ 'PuTTY' appeared around May/June 1998, and according to Simon,
# the development code made its first successful SSH connection 1998-05-29.
# So, all in all, this is why I give 1998 as date of the first release.
